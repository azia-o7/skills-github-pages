# Sine Waves Experimentation
## The original code
Whilst learning about 3D graphics in p5.js, I branched off to do my own research about what I could do with 3D which is how I came across Sine Waves. I started of with the original code just to build the basic sine wave so I could experiment with it further.
I followed this tutorial that I found on ** YouTube ** which gave a basic understanding of Sine Waves and some experimentation with it. I will link this below.
